# Claude Memory for trayicon-rs

## Project Status
This is a Rust library for creating tray icons that is cross-platform, supporting both Windows and macOS.

## Recent Work Completed

### macOS Implementation Modernization (2024)
- **Issue**: The macOS implementation was using deprecated `cocoa` and `objc` crates, causing numerous deprecation warnings during compilation
- **Solution**: Migrated the entire macOS implementation from deprecated crates to modern objc2 ecosystem
- **Changes Made**:
  - Updated `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
    - Removed: `cocoa = "0.26"` and `objc = "0.2"`
    - Added: `objc2 = "0.5"`, `objc2-app-kit = "0.2"`, `objc2-foundation = "0.2"`
  - Rewrote `/Users/bearice/Working/github/trayicon-rs/src/sys/macos/mod.rs` to use modern objc2 APIs:
    - Used `Id<T>` smart pointers instead of raw `id` pointers
    - Used `Allocated<T>` for proper object allocation
    - Used `msg_send_id!` macro for object initialization
    - Used `MainThreadMarker` for thread-safe NSMenu creation
    - Removed manual `release` calls (automatic with `Id<T>`)
  - Fixed compilation errors related to type safety and allocation patterns
  - Suppressed harmless dead code warnings for unused API methods

### Technical Details
- **Memory Management**: Modern objc2 provides automatic memory management through `Id<T>` smart pointers
- **Thread Safety**: Uses `MainThreadMarker` to ensure AppKit objects are created on the main thread
- **Type Safety**: objc2 provides better compile-time type checking compared to the old cocoa crate
- **Performance**: No performance impact, just modernized API usage

### Build Status
- ✅ All compilation warnings fixed
- ✅ Both main library and examples compile cleanly
- ✅ Cross-platform support maintained (Windows + macOS)
- ✅ Menu items now clickable and functional on macOS
- ✅ Icon changing functionality working on macOS

### macOS Code Refactoring (2024)
- **Issue**: The macOS implementation was contained in a single large `mod.rs` file, making it difficult to maintain and inconsistent with the Windows implementation structure
- **Solution**: Refactored the macOS implementation into focused modules following the same pattern as Windows
- **Changes Made**:
  - Split `src/sys/macos/mod.rs` into three focused modules:
    - `src/sys/macos/icon.rs` - `MacIcon` struct with `IconBase` trait implementation for NSImage management
    - `src/sys/macos/menu.rs` - `MacMenu` struct and menu building functions for NSMenu/NSMenuItem management
    - `src/sys/macos/trayicon.rs` - `MacTrayIcon` struct with `TrayIconBase` trait implementation for NSStatusItem management
  - Updated `src/sys/macos/mod.rs` to serve as a coordinator that re-exports types and delegates to modules
  - Maintained full API compatibility while improving code organization

### macOS Menu Action Implementation (2024)
- **Issue**: Menu items in macOS implementation were unclickable because they had no action handlers
- **Root Cause**: Menu items were created with `action: None::<Sel>` and no target object to receive clicks
- **Solution**: Implemented complete menu action handling system:
  - Created `MenuTarget` Objective-C class using `objc2::declare_class!` macro
  - Added `menuItemClicked:` action method to handle menu item clicks
  - Updated menu item creation to use proper action selectors and target objects
  - Added menu ID mapping system to associate menu tags with event IDs
  - Enhanced `MacMenu` struct with target object and sender rebinding capability
- **Technical Details**:
  - Menu items now created with `action: Some(Sel::register("menuItemClicked:"))`
  - Each menu item has `setTarget()` called to connect to the target object
  - Target object stores callback function that maps menu tags to events and calls sender
  - Added `update_sender()` method to rebind menu items when sender changes
  - Fixed compilation issue with `setState:` expecting `isize` instead of `i32`

### Files Modified
- `Cargo.toml` - Updated dependencies to objc2 ecosystem
- `src/sys/macos/mod.rs` - Refactored from monolithic implementation to module coordinator
- `src/sys/macos/icon.rs` - New module for icon functionality
- `src/sys/macos/menu.rs` - New module for menu functionality, now includes MenuTarget class for action handling
- `src/sys/macos/trayicon.rs` - New module for tray icon functionality, updated to wire up menu actions
- `src/menubuilder.rs` - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` for unused API method
- `src/trayiconsender.rs` - Added `#[allow(dead_code)]` for unused API components

## Build Commands
- `cargo build` - Builds the library and examples
- `cargo check` - Quick compilation check
- Both commands now complete without warnings

## Architecture
- **Windows**: Uses `winapi` crate for Win32 system tray integration
  - Modular structure: `winhicon.rs`, `winhmenu.rs`, `wintrayicon.rs`, `winnotifyicon.rs`
- **macOS**: Uses `objc2-app-kit` for NSStatusItem/NSMenu integration
  - Modular structure: `icon.rs`, `menu.rs`, `trayicon.rs` (matching Windows pattern)
- **Cross-platform**: Conditional compilation with `#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`
- **Consistent Design**: Both platforms now follow the same modular architecture pattern
